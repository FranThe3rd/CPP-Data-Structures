/* Two sum, basically you are looking for two numbers that equal to the target value.
 * You create a unordered_map, and then you make sure the key value pairs are ints.
 * The key is the value of the array, and the value of the map is the index of the array.
 * For example nums = {1,3,5}
 * The map would be {1:0,3:1,5:2}
 * Then you create a variable to subtract the target by the value of nums
 * If nums is inside of the map, you return it, because that means the specific index
 * where they found the answer in the map would both equal to the target.
